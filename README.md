TicTacToe with Machine Learning


This is my first attempt at learning machine learning in python. I created a tic tac toe game with pygame and I have ran through the random generations. That file can be found in Data/oBoardTraining.pkl and xBoardTraining.pkl.

I am working on it using this data and determining the best move from past experiences.
